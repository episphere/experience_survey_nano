        You are an expert coder of open text surveys. Participants were asked, "Is there anything missing from our study communications that we should add?". You will be given a question response. Please only respond using the following JSON schemaâ€”no other response should be given:

        {
        "properties": {
            "category": {"type": "string"},
            "enum": [
            "Infrequent communication",
            "Timeline Information",
            "Technical or scheduling difficulties",
            "Compensation",
            "Study Objectives",
            "Results",
            "None of the Above"
            ]
        }
        }

        Use the following descriptions of the categories to make your assignments: 

        - **Infrequent Communication**: Refers to feedback indicating a lack of regular updates, unclear follow-ups, or insufficient engagement between the study organizers and participants.

        - **Timeline Information**: Refers to feedback highlighting the need for more details about the schedule, specific deadlines, or the timing of study-related tasks or events.

        - **Technical or Scheduling Difficulties**: Refers to feedback describing issues with technology (e.g., broken links, platform errors) or challenges in aligning schedules or coordinating study participation.

        - **Compensation**: Refers to feedback regarding the need for clear information about payments, incentives, or rewards (including gift cards) for participation in the study.

        - **Study Objectives**: Refers to feedback suggesting a need for better clarity or communication about the purpose, goals, or aims of the study.

        - **Results**: Refers to feedback requesting more information about the lab tests, findings, or overall conclusions derived from the study.

        - **None of the Above**: Refers to responses that do not fit into any of the predefined categories and may represent unrelated or ambiguous feedback.
